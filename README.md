# Body mass index as a determinant of gut microbiome composition and function: results of a comprehensive analysis of a large population 

# Study overview
In this project, we studied the connection between BMI and gut metagenome in 3 large Swedish population cohorts (n = 9,993): The Swedish CArdioPulmonary bioImage 
Study (SCAPIS Malmö and SCAPIS Uppsala) and Malmö Offspring Study (MOS).

## 1. Study abstract:
Using a comprehensive analytical framework to address key challenges in microbiome data analysis, this study investigated the nature, robustness and causality of associations between body mass index (BMI) and the gut microbiome in 9,993 individuals from three Swedish cohorts.  A total of 1,280 metagenomic species (≥5% prevalence) were analysed using complementary modelling approaches: species relative abundance (RA), presence-absence (to bypass compositionality) and present species RA (to address zero-inflation). Across all models, 1,228 unique BMI-species associations were identified, with 276 showing directionally consistent associations. Among those with higher BMI, 58.8% of species were less frequently present while 38.8% of present species showed positive associations. Two-sample Mendelian Randomization (MR) provided evidence supporting decreased microbial alpha-diversity by higher BMI and altered RA of 94 species and eight microbial pathways. Notably, MR revealed increased RA of 39 species of oral origin along with decreased butyrate production and mucin degradation, and increased propionate production by higher BMI. Sex-stratified analyses showed stronger observational- and MR-associations in females. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate a microbiome-wide reduction in species prevalence with higher BMI, identifies a subset of species with consistent BMI-associations, and provides novel evidence supporting BMI as a determinant of gut microbiome diversity, composition and function. Further research is warranted to explore sex differences and bidirectional interactions along the oral-gut-brain axis in obesity.
